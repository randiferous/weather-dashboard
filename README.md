# weather-dashboard-challenge
- In the process of setting up my files, I decided to link to Bootstrap to expedite any styling task. 
- It was very important for me to get my retrieval from Local Storage to work properly (Local Storage has been my nemesis the past couple of challenges).
- Making sure that the city button in search history properly displayed the weather was a hurdle. I learned that an event.target could be used to pass parameters.
