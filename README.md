# weather-dashboard-challenge
- In the process of setting up my files, I decided to link to Bootstrap to expedite any styling task. 
- It was very important for me to get my retrieval from Local Storage to work properly (Local Storage has been my nemesis the past couple of challenges).
- Making sure that the city button in search history properly displayed the weather was a hurdle. I learned that an event.target could be used to pass parameters.
- Great "ah-ha" moment was figuring out how to display the weather icon
- I got to use the Network tab in DevTools to figure out where to extract weather information
- switching into imperial measurement for the temperature was a nice little hurdle
- when I got to displaying the UV Index, the load time became longer. I suspect it because of the second fetch request.
- I got to convert unix utc to daily time
